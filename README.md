** Ejean's Awesome App **
DISC Assignment 3

This repository contains the HTMI and CSS files
for the frontend implementation of a Figma wireframe. 

Specifically, this repository recreates the homepage of 
my social connection app, which shows the grid layout
displaying multiple users' profiles all at once.

The HTML code recreates the structure of the homepage, 
while the CSS code renders the page's style and formatting, including font size, colors, and spacing.
