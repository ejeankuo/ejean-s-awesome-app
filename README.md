** Ejean's Awesome App **
DISC Assignment 3

This repository contains the HTMI and CSS files
for the frontend implementation of a Figma wireframe. 

Specifically, this repository recreates the homepage for
my social connection app, which shows the grid layout
displaying multiple users' profiles all at once, as well
as a user's personal profile page, which shows their profile
information and their own posts in a grid format.

The HTML code recreates the structure of the homepage and 
profile page, while the CSS code renders each page's style 
and formatting, including font size, colors, and spacing.
